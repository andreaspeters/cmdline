CmdLine is a prompt component, which has a few extra features to fit better into
a VCL environment.

## Notice

This is a fork of the Original CMDLine from (Julian Schutsch )[https://wiki.lazarus.freepascal.org/CmdLine].

Changes you can find in CHANGELOG.md

## Features

- Dynamic line length: lines which are too long are wrapped (Word wrapping or
Char wrapping)
- Independent input buffer so you can still write during input
- Input history
- Copy/paste/cut for input
- Multispace font support
- ANSI escape codes or CmdBox special escape codes (or none if you switch them
off)
